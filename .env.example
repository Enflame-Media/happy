# Happy App Environment Variables
#
# IMPORTANT: Expo Environment Variable Rules
# ==========================================
# Expo's Metro bundler ONLY bundles variables with the EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix
# into the client app. Variables without this prefix will be UNDEFINED
# in production builds!
#
# ✅ CORRECT: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MY_VAR (works in production)
# ❌ WRONG:   process.env.MY_VAR (undefined in production)
# ❌ WRONG:   process.env.PUBLIC_EXPO_MY_VAR (wrong prefix order)
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.

# ============================================
# Client-Exposed Variables (EXPO_PUBLIC_*)
# ============================================
# These are bundled into the app at build time and accessible via process.env

# Happy server URL for API and WebSocket connections
# Default: https://happy-api.enflamemedia.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_HAPPY_SERVER_URL=https://happy-api.enflamemedia.com

# Enable debug mode (shows additional logging)
# EXPO_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true

# ============================================
# DEBUG - Use with extreme caution
# ============================================

# Enable debug logging to server (DANGEROUS - exposes session data to server)
# Only use in local development for AI-assisted debugging
# EXPO_PUBLIC_DANGEROUSLY_LOG_TO_SERVER_FOR_AI_AUTO_DEBUGGING=true

# ============================================
# Server-Only Variables (NO prefix needed)
# ============================================
# These are used during EAS Build or development server only.
# They are NOT bundled into the client app.
#
# Examples (if needed in future):
# - EAS_BUILD_* variables for build configuration
# - CI/CD pipeline variables
# - Build-time secrets that shouldn't be in client bundle
